### About Me 
One of my biggest interests is the development of the digital world and I found it very exciting thinking of how technology really can impact people's everyday lives. That is also why I started studying frontend development @Mediainstitutet in MalmÃ¶. 

In school I have gained knowledge (this far) in: 
<ul>
  <li> HTML </li>
  <li> CSS and Bootstrap </li>
  <li> Vanilla JavaScript </li>
  <li> mySQL </li>
  <li> Node JS </li>
  <li> Express </li>
  <li> Figma </li>
  <li> Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Adobe XD </li>
  
</ul>

... and by June I will also have learned: 
<ul>
  <li> TypeScript</li>
  <li> React </li>
  <li> APIs</li>
  <li> MongoDB </li>
</ul>
